# Twitter-Stock-Analysis--Machine-Learning-Model

In this project, we will be using various python and data science libraries to make a time series analysis of Twitter stocks.

> Perform a time series analysis on Twitter stocks and make a machine learning model. If possible, forecast whether the stock price will go into an uptrend or downtrend

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. The link to the dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/twitter-stocks-dataset?select=twitter-stocks.csv

Evaluation:

> If I can reach a >90% value in my prediction and identify a trend, I'll further evaluate the project

After using various machine learning models, the conclusion reached was:

The stock prices for Twitter have been increasing over the years. The stock prices have been increasing since 2016 and have been decreasing since 2021.

We used various machine learning models to predict the stock prices and they all gave a very similar score which shows a reliable trend in the prices.

The model gave a very accurate score of 0.9988384036913411 (~99%) which is backed up by the scatter plot. This result was given by the Linear Regression model which proved to be the most accurate model.

The MSE value is also very low (close to 0) which shows that the model is very accurate.

We can also see that the volume of stocks traded has been increasing since 2021 which shows that there is a lot of buying pressure in the market, as well as the open price for 2021 was the highest amongst all other years, with the value decreasing in 2022.
